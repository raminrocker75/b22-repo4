I just created Empty Remote repository from GitHUb.com account by clicking on the plus icon on top right corner and new repository, and give a name and click create.




And Cloned this repository by clicking on set up in desktop and(Optionally select the location) click on clone.

It cloned our remote to repo local so we can start working locally.
